# COVID19-Project collabrate with Forodwaith(github name)

Invastigated three questions:
1.Does the epidemic affect men and women equally, and does the gender-balance vary by age? What about the same question for the recovery rate?
2.Does the method of contraction of the disease vary by age group or gender?
3.Do the richest regions (measured by real estate prices) and most economically active regions (measured by the number of real estate sales) tend to have the most or least number of cases?

Two datasets:
Our primary data set consists of a table of confirmed cases with personal details, dates associated with the contraction of the disease, the probable cause of infection, the current status of the case, and information about the health unit at which the case was reported.
This table can be found at: https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed- positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario
In order to interpret the data, we made use of an accompanying “dictio- nary” which explains the role of each column in the table.

A secondary data set consists of a list of properties sold in Ontario in July, 2016 containing addresses and prices. Although the data is from a few years back, we think it is still reliable enough to serve our purpose well.
This table can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/mnabaee/ontarioproperties
In order to make use of the data, we simplify it by only keeping the ad- dress, area and price. This will be sufficient for our purposes.
